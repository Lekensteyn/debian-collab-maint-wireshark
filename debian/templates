_Description: Do you want dumpcap to be installed setuid root?
 Dumpcap can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so members of
 group wireshark will be able to run it with the permissions of the 
 'root' user. It is the preferred way of capturing packets using 
 Wireshark/Tshark over running Wireshark/Tshark as root, because that 
 way most of the code will run with less priveges.
 .
 Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by
 default.  If in doubt, it is suggested to leave it disabled.
