Subject: [PATCH 5/5] packet-amqp.c: Temporary/preliminary fix for Bug #10582
 (crash)

This is a temporary/preliminary fix to prevent the buildbot fuzz-test
 failures seen when testing the capture file attached to Bug #10582.

As noted in the bug, a complete fix will require some reworking of
  the amqp dissector.
